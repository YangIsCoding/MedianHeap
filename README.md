# MedianHeap
 The median of a dynamically changing sequence of numbers.
 This program uses two heaps to maintain the median of a dynamically changing sequence of numbers. It continuously reads input numbers and places them in either a max heap or a min heap based on their values. The program adjusts the heap sizes and performs heap operations to ensure the heaps maintain their properties. After each adjustment, it calculates the current median based on the sizes of the heaps. Finally, it outputs the median to the standard output after each calculation.
